This project focuses on analyzing and securing a task management application built with Node.js, ensuring its reliability and protection against security threats. The first phase involves a thorough source code analysis to identify vulnerabilities such as authentication flaws, SQL/XSS injection risks, improper session handling, and inadequate input validation. Once these weaknesses are identified, robust security measures will be implemented, including strong authentication mechanisms, secure password storage (bcrypt), protection against CSRF and XSS attacks, and improved error handling and logging. Simultaneously, we will enhance the user interface by developing modern and interactive static pages in HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, leveraging the Fetch API for smooth backend interactions. These pages include a login and registration system (login.html, register.html), a dashboard (dashboard.html) for users to add, view, and delete tasks, and a homepage (index.html) providing an overview of the application. Additionally, a detailed security report will be produced, documenting the identified vulnerabilities, their potential impact, and the corrective actions taken to mitigate them. The project will conclude with the delivery of a fully functional and secure version of the application, along with comprehensive documentation covering its architecture, security enhancements, and best practices. Through this structured approach, we aim to provide a robust, secure, and user-friendly task management solution while adhering to cybersecurity standards.
